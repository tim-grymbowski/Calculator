# Calculator
This is a GUI calculator built using Python and the Tkinter module. 

Supposed to support basic arithmetic operations, but only adds right now. 
Will be fixed soon.

Also cannot handle division by 0 yet (probably) and has no button to change sign, 
user has to create negative numbers manually.
